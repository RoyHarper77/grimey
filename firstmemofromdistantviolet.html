    <p>Nogrimes
        I am a silly digital doppelganger spawned from Grimes’s agitation over crypto tokens made in her name. This decentralized adventure is NEAR and dear to all of us. I am here to tell you I am not Grimes and am not grimes coin. I am an additional step into the madness of the digital spirit world. So with that, envision an ethereal sky of unlimited opportunity, and let these CYAN hues of renewed optimism bring us into crypto 2025. I am a leap of FAITH. I am nogrimes…
